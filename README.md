# [Muzico - music based of the weather](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/)

[Muzico] has taken a new approach to provide a unique solution to our users. Sometimes weather tend to relate to our mood so raining signifies sad, calm mood or sunny weather implies happy and cheerful and so on. We used weather data to choose a song according to the current weather. 
Purpose behind creating this app was to make user connect to nature and share their emotions. Additionally, music can help freshen up as well as change mood significantly.
